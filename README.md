# Car Damage detection using Detectron2 
Demo(https://huggingface.co/spaces/ishaal007/CarDamageDetection)<br />

Created own dataset and annoted damages in the types like Scratch,Dents,Dislocation and shatter.<br />
Used Detectron2 and Faster RCNN R50 model for training.<br />
Deployed using Gradio app and hosted on huggingface.<br />
Own COCO Format dataset created. Model training code availabel in ipynb file.<br />
Dataset Link:"!curl -L "https://app.roboflow.com/ds/fsu1wRqbfZ?key=bfRcfkmehm" > roboflow.zip; unzip roboflow.zip; rm roboflow.zip"<br />
app.py is gradio file.<br />
mycongif file is the file required for the our models custom configuration save it during the training.
